# Storybook stories

This directory contains component demos written for the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) UI Development Environment.

## Development

To add stories for a new component, create a file with the `.stories.js` extension matching the component name. A Storybook module should aim to showcase every visual state of a component - generally, these are examples configuring each property the component offers.
